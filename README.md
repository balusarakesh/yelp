This web scraping project helps to collect data from Yelp(http://www.yelp.com/) website and store it in your database. 

How to use:
 - setup your DB in the yelp/settings.py, if not set then a default DB will be used locally.
 - run the command "./manage.py runserver".
 - goto the url "http://localhost/collector" and start collecting data.

Any feedback is appreciated.
